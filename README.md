**Spend caps, receipts, and automatic reconciliation for AI runs.**

Decisionproof turns AI decision runs into budget-bounded, auditable, settlement-safe operations. You submit a run with a hard spend cap. The platform reserves budget, executes the work, writes a result artifact, and only then settles the cost. If a worker crashes, a lease expires, or a retry collides, a reconciliation loop rolls the run forward or back — deterministically, without silent money drift.

Built for teams that treat AI execution as an accountable economic transaction: decisions need to clear cleanly, cost needs to settle predictably, and the audit trail has to hold up under review.

This release is a paid private beta. APIs, limits, and operational defaults may change without notice. No uptime SLA during the beta period.

- Access requires account registration and payment at [decisionproof.io.kr](https://decisionproof.io.kr)
- PayPal is the only supported payment method during beta
- $29 USD per 30-day cycle, manual renewal only (no auto-renewal)
- Rate limits and per-run cost caps apply (see [API docs](https://decisionproof.io.kr/docs/quickstart.html))

## Why Decisionproof is different

Agent frameworks, durable execution engines, and orchestration toolkits cover **how** an AI run is constructed and resumed. Decisionproof sits one layer up: it governs **what a run is allowed to spend, how completion is proven, and how cost settles** when things go wrong.

- **Spend caps, reserved before work starts.** A run that would exceed its cap is rejected, not truncated mid-execution.
- **Receipt-backed settlement.** Cost is committed only when the result artifact is written and its metadata is captured. No receipt means no settlement.
- **Reaper reconciliation.** A continuous loop scans for lease expiry, stuck finalize stages, and missing receipts — and rolls forward or back deterministically.
- **Audit trail as first-class output.** Every run is recorded as a complete input → state transitions → result → settlement record, exportable at any time.

This is not a replacement for your agent framework. It is the financial and operational control layer you run around it.

## What is Decisionproof?

Decisionproof runs *decision packs* (units of work) as **runs** through a distributed pipeline:

1. **API** validates the request, enforces plan and spend-cap limits, and enqueues work.
2. **Worker** executes the pack from a queue and produces a result artifact. Depending on pack type, a worker performs structured scoring, URL screening, OCR/document extraction, or research-style processing. The result is written to durable storage so downstream systems can review outcomes under a controlled audit trail.
3. **Reaper** continuously reconciles edge cases (stuck runs, lease expiry, partial commits) using deterministic roll-forward / roll-back rules.

The core design goal is to remain **failure-safe** under retries, timeouts, and worker crashes by combining:
- **Idempotency** at the API boundary (per-tenant idempotency key).
- **Leases + heartbeats** for long-running work.
- **Receipt-based settlement** where result-store metadata acts as the authoritative proof for reconciliation.

---

## How it works (technical overview)

### Run lifecycle (high level)

A run moves through a state machine similar to:

- `RESERVED` → `QUEUED` → `PROCESSING` → `COMPLETED | FAILED`

Key mechanisms:

- **Idempotency:** a DB-level unique constraint on `(tenant_id, idempotency_key)` prevents duplicate run creation when clients retry.  
- **Leases:** Workers claim a run with a lease token and extend `lease_expires_at` periodically to prevent false zombie detection during long executions.
- **Optimistic locking:** critical updates use a version-based check to prevent concurrent state corruption.

### Money flow (zero leak design)

Decisionproof treats cost settlement as a “receipt-backed” flow:

1. **Reserve budget** (atomic) → run becomes `RESERVED`
2. **Write DB + enqueue** (transaction-aware) → `QUEUED`
3. Worker **claims lease** (CAS / token) → `PROCESSING`
4. Worker executes pack → computes `actual_cost`
5. Worker finalizes via a staged flow:

   - **PHASE 1 — CLAIM** (finalize stage = `CLAIMED`)
   - **PHASE 2 — RESULT UPLOAD** (result store metadata includes `actual_cost_usd_micros`)
   - **PHASE 3 — COMMIT** (settle budget with actual cost, persist completion, delete queue message)

6. **Reaper reconciliation** continuously checks for partial/failed transitions:

   - **Lease expired:** rollback/refund + mark as failed (policy-dependent)
   - **CLAIMED stuck:** *roll-forward* if result exists, else *roll-back*
   - **No receipt:** raise `AUDIT_REQUIRED` (critical alert)

This design makes it possible to recover deterministically after crashes without “silent money drift”.

## API surface (pilot)

### Base endpoints (local)

- `GET /health` — liveness probe (always 200 OK)
- `GET /readyz` — readiness probe (checks DB/Redis/S3/SQS; returns 503 if any dependency is down)
- `GET /docs` — Swagger UI (OpenAPI)
- `GET /redoc` — ReDoc

### Demo Marketplace (RapidAPI)

A locked public surface for the RapidAPI marketplace listing. Requires `X-RapidAPI-Proxy-Secret` header. Fail-closed: returns 503 if proxy secret is not configured.

- `POST /v1/demo/runs` — submit a demo run
- `GET /v1/demo/runs/{run_id}` — poll result (rate-limited: one poll per interval)
- `GET /.well-known/openapi-demo.json` — locked OpenAPI spec for the demo surface (no auth required)

### Run API (example)

Submit a run:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/runs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dpp_live_abc123..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: my-unique-key-123" \
  -d '{
    "pack_type": "decision",
    "inputs": {
      "question": "Should I launch this product?",
      "mode": "detailed"
    },
    "max_cost_usd": "5.00"
  }'
```

Get run status:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/runs/<RUN_ID> \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dpp_live_abc123..."
```

## Reliability primitives (why it stays predictable)

### 1) Idempotency & retries
- Clients can safely retry with the same `Idempotency-Key`.
- The API returns the existing run instead of creating duplicates.

### 2) Heartbeat & visibility extension
- Workers extend:
  - DB lease (`lease_expires_at`)
  - SQS visibility timeout
- This prevents premature “zombie” recovery while a legitimate long job is still running.

### 3) Reconciliation loop (Reaper)
- The Reaper periodically scans for:
  - expired leases
  - stuck finalize stages
  - missing receipts / inconsistent states
- It uses deterministic rules to either roll-forward or roll-back.

## Security model (pilot)

- **API keys:** stored hashed (SHA-256), validated with format + checksum; revocable from the dashboard.
- **Errors:** RFC 9457 `application/problem+json` for consistent, machine-parseable error handling.
- **CORS:** production uses an explicit allowlist via `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (dev fallback uses localhost variants; never `"*"` with credentials).
- **Supabase / Postgres SSOT:** the production guide assumes Supabase Postgres as the primary DB. RLS is enabled for public tables with a default-deny stance.
- **Tenant isolation:** API keys only authorize access to their own tenant's runs and audit records.
- **Payments:** PayPal only during beta. No card numbers or payment credentials are stored by Decisionproof.

These are architectural controls, not certifications. Decisionproof does not claim third-party compliance certifications or regulatory coverage during the paid private beta.

> For security reporting, do not open a public issue. Use GitHub Security Advisories / private reporting when enabled.
